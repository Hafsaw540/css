      <em><h2>HISTORY OF PAKISTAN</h2></em>
      <p>
        Pakistan came into being on <strong> August 14, 1947 </strong> as a
        result of the partition of British India. On its east and southeast lies
        India, on the north and northwest is Afghanistan, to the west is Iran,
        and toward the south is the Arabian Sea. Pakistan shares a common border
        with China. According to the 1998 Census, its population included 135
        million citizens and estimates suggest that number increased to 145
        million by <strong> 2003 </strong>. Two-thirds of the population live in
        rural areas, and engage in agriculture as the main source of livelihood.
        The majority of the population is composed of Muslims; the remaining are
        Hindus, Christians, and Parsees. About twenty languages are spoken in
        Pakistan. Urdu is the national language of the country, but English
        continues to be used for education, commercial, and other official
        purposes. Pakistanâ€™s literacy rate was 47 percent in 1998. Politically,
        Pakistan is a federation of four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Northwest
        Frontier Province, and Balochistan). Administratively, the provinces are
        comprised of districts, which are divided into small subdivisions
        (Tehsils). These are further divided into union councils.
